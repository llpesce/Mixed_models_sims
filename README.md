# Mixed_models_sims collection of R files

Simulation files to compare regression models for multivariate data
Comparing_DREAM_Limma_longitudinal.R    creates a relatively simple model for a differential expression analysis
                for longitudinal data with correlation and a variable time between expression at t1 and expression
                at t2. It compares limma (with and without blocking, with and without duplicate.correlation and Dream)
Testing_QTL_models.R compares ReQTL approaches in presence of noise  and correlation (in signal and in eQTL effect)
Testing_properties-of_simple_models.R	to show how some models are equivalent to a paired t-test white others aren't.
